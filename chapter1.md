Aaron was always the go-to guy when something needed fixing in the small town of Oakridge. He was a skilled handyman and had a knack for tinkering with broken appliances and gadgets. So when the old clock in the town square abruptly stopped working one sunny afternoon, it was no surprise that everyone turned to Aaron for help.

The clock had been a fixture in Oakridge for as long as anyone could remember. But now, the hands were frozen in place, and the once soothing tick-tock of the clock was replaced with an eerie silence.

Aaron was intrigued by the challenge . He gathered his tools and headed to the town square, where a crowd of curious onlookers had gathered to watch him work his magic. As he examined the clock, he noticed that the gears were jammed, causing the hands to stop moving. It was a simple fix, or so he thought.
