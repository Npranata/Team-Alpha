When the light finally faded, Aaron found himself standing in a strange and unfamiliar landscape. The sky was a swirling maelstrom of colors, and the ground beneath his feet pulsed with an otherworldly energy. He realized with a sinking feeling in his gut that he was no longer in Oakridge, but somewhere far beyond the reaches of his understanding.

The figure loomed before him, its cloak billowing in the unnatural wind. "You have trespassed into forbidden territory, mortal," it intoned. "And now you must face the consequences of your actions."

Aaron's mind raced as he tried to make sense of his surroundings. Was this some kind of alternate dimension, existing outside the confines of time and space? Or was he simply caught in the grip of a powerful hallucination, brought on by the trauma of his near-death experience?

As the figure advanced towards him, Aaron knew that he had to do something, anything, to escape this nightmarish realm. With a surge of adrenaline, he lunged towards the broken clock, grabbing hold of its shattered face with a strength he didn't know he possessed.
